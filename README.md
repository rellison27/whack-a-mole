# Whack-A-Mole
<em> To learn how to play scroll to the bottom.</em><br><br>
I created this Whack-A-Mole game from scratch. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Before running the app please read the "Controls" section.

# Installation
- `$ Git clone https://github.com/rellison27/whack-a-mole.git`

- If you downloaded the zip file, unpack the files in the zip folder.

# Run App

<h2>On Computer</h2>

Once you have downloaded all of the files, open the index.html file inside the Whack-a-mole folder. To open the file use a browser, preferably google chrome, safari, or mozilla.

<h3> For IE11 </h3>

If using IE11 I recommend going to the "Play Now" section above, but if you're savy or want a challenge you can run a simple local server with Python. Follow these steps (assuming you're not using a Mac) 
1. Download Python
2. Use the terminal to `cd /path/to/repo` 
3. Then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
4. Open your browser and in the url input type `localhost:8000`

<h3> On Phone/Tablet </h3>

Click the link in the "Play Now" section if you have a <strong>Samsung</strong> S7, S8,or a tablet (it should work normally in both landscape and portrait positions).
If you only see four brown rectangular blocks stacked on top of each other <strong>zoom out</strong> and hit play.
If you have an <strong>iPhone or iPhone7+</strong> you may not be able zoom out. Instead, turn your device to the side and voila! Game on!
