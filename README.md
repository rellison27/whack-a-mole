# Whack-A-Mole
This is a Whack-A-Mole game that I created from scratch. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Before running the app please read the "Controls" section first.

- If you downloaded the zip file. Unpack the files in the zip folder.

# Run App

<h2>On Computer</h2>

Once you have downloaded all of the files. Open the index.html file inside Whack-a-mole folder in a browser. Preferably google chrome, safari, or mozilla.

<h3> For IE11 </h3>

If you ABSOLUTELY LOVE IE11 I recommend just going to the site above in the "Play Now" section but if you're savy or want a challenge you can run a simple local server with Python. Follow these steps (assuming you're not using a virtual box on Mac after downloading Python) 

1. Use the terminal to `cd /path/to/repo` 
2. Then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
3. Open your browser and in the url input type `localhost:8000`

<h3> On Phone/Tablet </h3>

click the link in the "Play Now" section if you have a Samsung S7 or S8 it should work normally (in both positions)
If you only see four brown rectangular blocks stacked on top of each other zoom out and hit play.
If you an iphone or iphone7+ you may not be able zoom out to see the whole app *HOWEVER
